1. ï»¿Folders:
1)data: 
	Stores all .mat files. The .mat files record time consumption of each algorithm in different maps.
2)newMaps2.zip: 
	Stores all maps. There are 30 different scales and there are 50 random maps under each scale, that is, we tested 1500 maps totally.
3)exampleMaps:
	Stores 3 exemplified maps: exampleMap0.mat is the map shown in Fig. 1 in the main text; exampleMap1.mat is the map shown in Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Notes; exampleMap2.mat is a map with the edge FG weighted 1000 but all other parts being the same with Fig. 1.

2. .m files:
	1)main.m:
		Run it to test 4 algorithm in 1500 maps. Time consumption is stored as output in .mat files, data folder.

	2)main_make_map.m:
		Run it to generate 1500 maps. We use Dijkstra to make sure every map is a connected graph. This code is also used to generate digraph samples.

	3)OrderMap.m:
		Change an adjacency table to an adjacency matrix.

	4)make_time_table.m:
		Through Dijkstra, create a timetable as a heuristic function h() of the AS algorithm.

	5)Display.m
		Display code of Dijkstra and Dijkstra_Extend.

	8)main_exampleMap.m
		Run it to test how RA works on exemplified maps.

	6)Display_alpha.m
		Display the shortest pathes in 'letter node' style.


3. Resonance (Folder):
	1)resonanceAlg.m
		Guide code of Dijkstra and Resonance algorithm.

	2)Forward.m , Backward.m , FindPaths.m :
		Core code of Resonance Algorithm. Corresponding to the forward, backward, and overlapping processes of the Resonance Algorithm.

	3)NodesBook.m:
		Gives which node links to which in Resonance Algorithm.

	4)print_path.m: 
		Recurse to organize the shortest path into an easy-to-read form.

	5)DispPaths.m:
		Display.

	6)DispPaths.m:
		Display in 'letter node' style.

4. Dijkstra (Folder):
	1)Dijkstra_Arithmetic.m:
		Guides to the optimized Dijkstra, which can only find one shortest path. 

	2)Compute.m:
		Core computing code of Dijkstra_Extend, Dijkstra_Origin.


5. Dijkstra_Extend (Folder):
	1)Dijkstra_Arithmetic_Extend.m:
		Guides to the optimized Dijkstra, which can find all the shortest paths.

	2)Compute_Extend.m:
		Core computing code of Dijkstra_Extend, Dijkstra_Origin.
